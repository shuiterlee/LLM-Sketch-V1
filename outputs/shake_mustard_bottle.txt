The user command is "shake the mustard bottle".



////////// GPT-4 //////////

INITIAL PLANNING 1:

To shake the mustard bottle, the robot arm should grasp the bottle by its body, which is typically narrower than the cap and base. This will allow the gripper to have a secure hold on the bottle while shaking it.

Let's start by detecting the mustard bottle in the environment.

```python
detect_object("mustard bottle")
```



////////// PRINT OUTPUT //////////

Print statement output:
Position of mustard bottle: [-0.099, 0.17, 0.052]
Dimensions:
Width: 0.097
Length: 0.156
Height: 0.058
Orientation along shorter side (width): 0.268
Orientation along longer side (length): -1.301 



////////// GPT-4 //////////

INITIAL PLANNING 2:

Since there is only one mustard bottle, we don't need to decide which object to interact with. 

The best way to approach the mustard bottle would be to approach it along its shorter side (width), as the gripper can only grasp objects along sides which are shorter than 0.08. The orientation along the shorter side is 0.268 radians.

DETAILED PLAN:

1. Move the end-effector above the mustard bottle, aligning it with the bottle's orientation.
2. Lower the end-effector to the bottle's height.
3. Close the gripper to grasp the bottle.
4. Lift the bottle slightly above the table.
5. Shake the bottle by moving the end-effector up and down a few times.
6. Lower the bottle back to the table.
7. Open the gripper to release the bottle.
8. Move the end-effector back to its initial position.

Let's start by moving the end-effector above the mustard bottle.

```python
def generate_trajectory(start_pose, end_pose):
    """
    Generate a trajectory from start_pose to end_pose.
    Each pose is a list of length 4, comprising a 3D position and a rotation value.
    """
    trajectory = []
    for i in range(100):
        pose = [start_pose[j] + i/99 * (end_pose[j] - start_pose[j]) for j in range(4)]
        trajectory.append(pose)
    return trajectory

# Start pose is the current end-effector pose
start_pose = [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0]

# End pose is above the mustard bottle, with the same orientation as the bottle
end_pose = [-0.099, 0.17, 0.7, 0.268]

trajectory_1 = generate_trajectory(start_pose, end_pose)
execute_trajectory(trajectory_1)
```



////////// GPT-4 //////////

Now that the end-effector is positioned above the mustard bottle, let's lower it to the bottle's height.

```python
# Start pose is the current end-effector pose
start_pose = [-0.099, 0.17, 0.7, 0.268]

# End pose is at the mustard bottle's height, with the same orientation as the bottle
end_pose = [-0.099, 0.17, 0.052, 0.268]

trajectory_2 = generate_trajectory(start_pose, end_pose)
execute_trajectory(trajectory_2)
```



////////// GPT-4 //////////

Now that the end-effector is at the mustard bottle's height, let's close the gripper to grasp the bottle.

```python
close_gripper()
```



////////// GPT-4 //////////

Now that the gripper has grasped the mustard bottle, let's lift the bottle slightly above the table.

```python
# Start pose is the current end-effector pose
start_pose = [-0.099, 0.17, 0.052, 0.268]

# End pose is slightly above the table, with the same orientation as the bottle
end_pose = [-0.099, 0.17, 0.15, 0.268]

trajectory_3 = generate_trajectory(start_pose, end_pose)
execute_trajectory(trajectory_3)
```



////////// GPT-4 //////////

Now that the mustard bottle is lifted, let's shake the bottle by moving the end-effector up and down a few times.

```python
def generate_shake_trajectory(start_pose, amplitude, frequency):
    """
    Generate a trajectory for shaking motion.
    The shaking motion is along the z-axis, with a specified amplitude and frequency.
    """
    trajectory = []
    for i in range(100):
        pose = start_pose.copy()
        pose[2] += amplitude * math.sin(2 * math.pi * frequency * i/99)  # Shake along z-axis
        trajectory.append(pose)
    return trajectory

# Start pose is the current end-effector pose
start_pose = [-0.099, 0.17, 0.15, 0.268]

# Shake amplitude and frequency
amplitude = 0.05  # 5 cm
frequency = 2  # 2 cycles per trajectory

trajectory_4 = generate_shake_trajectory(start_pose, amplitude, frequency)
execute_trajectory(trajectory_4)
```



////////// GPT-4 //////////

Now that the mustard bottle has been shaken, let's lower the bottle back to the table.

```python
# Start pose is the current end-effector pose
start_pose = [-0.099, 0.17, 0.15, 0.268]

# End pose is at the mustard bottle's original height, with the same orientation as the bottle
end_pose = [-0.099, 0.17, 0.052, 0.268]

trajectory_5 = generate_trajectory(start_pose, end_pose)
execute_trajectory(trajectory_5)
```



////////// GPT-4 //////////

Now that the mustard bottle is back on the table, let's open the gripper to release the bottle.

```python
open_gripper()
```



////////// GPT-4 //////////

Now that the gripper has released the mustard bottle, let's move the end-effector back to its initial position.

```python
# Start pose is the current end-effector pose
start_pose = [-0.099, 0.17, 0.052, 0.268]

# End pose is the initial end-effector pose
end_pose = [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0]

trajectory_6 = generate_trajectory(start_pose, end_pose)
execute_trajectory(trajectory_6)
```



////////// GPT-4 //////////

Now that the end-effector is back at its initial position, the task of shaking the mustard bottle has been completed.

```python
task_completed()
```
