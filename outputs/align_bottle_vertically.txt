The user command is "align the bottle vertically".



////////// GPT-4 //////////

INITIAL PLANNING 1:

To align the bottle vertically, the robot arm needs to grasp the bottle at its body, which is usually the widest part of the bottle. This will provide a stable grip and allow the robot to rotate the bottle as needed.

Let's start by detecting the bottle in the environment.

```python
detect_object("bottle")
```
Stop generation here and wait for the output of the detect_object function.



////////// PRINT OUTPUT //////////

Print statement output:
Position of bottle: [0.011, 0.209, 0.055]
Dimensions:
Width: 0.218
Length: 0.049
Height: 0.063
Orientation along shorter side (length): -1.343
Orientation along longer side (width): 0.238 



////////// GPT-4 //////////

INITIAL PLANNING 2:

From the printed output, we can see that the bottle is lying on its side, as the width is greater than the height. The orientation along the shorter side (length) is -1.343 radians, which means the bottle is rotated clockwise from the x-axis. 

The robot arm should approach the bottle from above, aiming for the midpoint of the bottle's body. This will allow the gripper to securely grasp the bottle. 

The trajectory plan is as follows:

1. Move the end-effector to a point above the midpoint of the bottle, with the gripper open and oriented to match the bottle's orientation.
2. Lower the end-effector to make contact with the bottle and close the gripper.
3. Lift the bottle slightly above the table.
4. Rotate the bottle to a vertical position.
5. Lower the bottle back onto the table.
6. Open the gripper and move the end-effector away from the bottle.

Let's start with the first step of the trajectory.

```python
# Define the initial position of the end-effector
initial_pose = [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.0]

# Define the position above the midpoint of the bottle
bottle_position = [0.011, 0.209, 0.7, -1.343]

# Define a function to generate a straight-line trajectory
def generate_straight_line_trajectory(start_pose, end_pose, num_points=100):
    """
    Generate a straight-line trajectory between two poses.

    Parameters:
    start_pose (list): The start pose of the trajectory, in the format [x, y, z, rotation].
    end_pose (list): The end pose of the trajectory, in the format [x, y, z, rotation].
    num_points (int): The number of points in the trajectory.

    Returns:
    list: The trajectory, as a list of poses.
    """
    trajectory = []
    for i in range(num_points):
        t = i / (num_points - 1)
        pose = [
            (1 - t) * start_pose[0] + t * end_pose[0],
            (1 - t) * start_pose[1] + t * end_pose[1],
            (1 - t) * start_pose[2] + t * end_pose[2],
            (1 - t) * start_pose[3] + t * end_pose[3]
        ]
        trajectory.append(pose)
    return trajectory

# Generate the trajectory
trajectory_1 = generate_straight_line_trajectory(initial_pose, bottle_position)

# Execute the trajectory
execute_trajectory(trajectory_1)
```
Stop generation here and wait for the trajectory to finish executing.



////////// GPT-4 //////////

Now that the end-effector is positioned above the bottle, let's proceed to the next step of the trajectory: lowering the end-effector to make contact with the bottle and closing the gripper.

```python
# Define the position of the end-effector in contact with the bottle
contact_position = [0.011, 0.209, 0.055, -1.343]

# Generate the trajectory
trajectory_2 = generate_straight_line_trajectory(bottle_position, contact_position)

# Execute the trajectory
execute_trajectory(trajectory_2)

# Close the gripper
close_gripper()
```
Stop generation here and wait for the trajectory to finish executing and the gripper to close.



////////// GPT-4 //////////

Now that the gripper has grasped the bottle, let's proceed to the next step of the trajectory: lifting the bottle slightly above the table.

```python
# Define the position of the end-effector holding the bottle above the table
lift_position = [0.011, 0.209, 0.2, -1.343]

# Generate the trajectory
trajectory_3 = generate_straight_line_trajectory(contact_position, lift_position)

# Execute the trajectory
execute_trajectory(trajectory_3)
```
Stop generation here and wait for the trajectory to finish executing.



////////// GPT-4 //////////

Now that the bottle is lifted, let's proceed to the next step of the trajectory: rotating the bottle to a vertical position.

```python
# Define the position of the end-effector holding the bottle in a vertical position
vertical_position = [0.011, 0.209, 0.2, 0.0]

# Generate the trajectory
trajectory_4 = generate_straight_line_trajectory(lift_position, vertical_position)

# Execute the trajectory
execute_trajectory(trajectory_4)
```
Stop generation here and wait for the trajectory to finish executing.



////////// GPT-4 //////////

Now that the bottle is vertical, let's proceed to the next step of the trajectory: lowering the bottle back onto the table.

```python
# Define the position of the end-effector placing the bottle back on the table
place_position = [0.011, 0.209, 0.063, 0.0]

# Generate the trajectory
trajectory_5 = generate_straight_line_trajectory(vertical_position, place_position)

# Execute the trajectory
execute_trajectory(trajectory_5)
```
Stop generation here and wait for the trajectory to finish executing.



////////// GPT-4 //////////

Now that the bottle is back on the table, let's proceed to the final step of the trajectory: opening the gripper and moving the end-effector away from the bottle.

```python
# Open the gripper
open_gripper()

# Define the final position of the end-effector
final_position = [0.011, 0.209, 0.7, 0.0]

# Generate the trajectory
trajectory_6 = generate_straight_line_trajectory(place_position, final_position)

# Execute the trajectory
execute_trajectory(trajectory_6)

# Indicate that the task has been completed
task_completed()
```
Stop generation here and wait for the trajectory to finish executing and the task to be completed.
